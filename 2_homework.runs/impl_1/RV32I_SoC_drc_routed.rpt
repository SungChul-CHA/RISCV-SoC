PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net iCPU/regfile_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_7_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin iCPU/regfile_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_1/O, cell iCPU/regfile_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net iDec/bbstub_douta[13]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin iDec/b_true_reg_i_2/O, cell iDec/b_true_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net iDec/cs_gpio_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin iDec/cs_gpio_reg/L3_2/O, cell iDec/cs_gpio_reg/L3_2 (in iDec/cs_gpio_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

REQP-1839#20 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 iMEM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.TRUE_DP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram has an input control pin iMEM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.TRUE_DP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRBWRADDR[14] (net: iMEM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/addrb[10]) which is driven by a register (iCPU/pc_reg[29]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
