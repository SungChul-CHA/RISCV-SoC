2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin rst_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock iPLL/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin iPLL/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_125mhz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_125mhz_IBUF_inst/O, iPLL/clk_in1, rst_reg/C
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell iCPU/alu_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) iDec/cs_gpio_reg/CLR, iDec/cs_mem_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch iDec/cs_gpio_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin iDec/cs_gpio_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch iDec/cs_mem_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin iDec/cs_mem_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
